and pair-rule genes were discovered in this organism; those genes are responsible for segmentation of
their bodies. The salivary glands of this organism contain oversized chromosomes, and this organism
contains transposons called P elements. The concept of sex-linked traits was proposed by Thomas

9. A constant plus this function is used to approximate partial sums of the harmonic series. The
Mercator series is used to approximate this function applied to the quantity 1 + x, and is calculated
by alternately adding and subtracting terms of the form xn /n [“x to the nth power, divided by n”].
Applying the complex version of this function to negative one yields the opposite of i times pi. The
derivative of this function is the reciprocal function, 1/x [“one over x”]. This function was used to
design slide rules and is used for the decibel and Richter scales. Name this function, the inverse of
the exponential function, that uses the base e.

10. One system to predict this phenomenon is the IRI/CPC plume, which is based on data from the
3.4 region. This phenomenon occurs after the Madden–Julian oscillation and either the weakening or
reversal of the Walker circulation. One part of predicting this event compares the Darwin pressure
anomaly to the Tahiti pressure anomaly, and this event is often followed by a smaller event whose
changes are in the opposite direction. This phenomenon includes a strong jet stream across the
southern United States and warm temperatures in the Pacific, and it occurs approximately every five
years. Name this part of the Southern Oscillation that is often followed by La Niña.

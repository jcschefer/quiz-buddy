1. One method of synthesizing these molecules is controlled by the redox equilibrium between halide
salts of copper one and copper two. That reaction is considered “living” as it lacks a termination step,
and is useful because it provides great control of the products made. The relative stereochemistry
of chiral [KY-rul] centers in these molecules is called the tacticity [“tack”-TIH-sih-tee], and that
can be visualized with a Natta projection. One compound of this type is formed by combining
hexa·methyl·ene·di·amine and a·di·pic acid. PVC and rubber are made of these molecules, as is
nylon. Name these large molecules containing repeated units called monomers.
Answer: polymers

60. These values are all included in a region described by the Gershgorin Circle Theorem. The set of all
of these values for a particular transformation is called the spectrum, and all of them are real if the
 transformation they come from is self-adjoint or Hermitian [air-MEE-shun]. Counting multiplicity, the
sum of these values equals the trace. Diagonalization leaves these quantities along the diagonal. These
are the solutions to a characteristic polynomial, which is generated by subtracting a variable times an
identity matrix from the original matrix. Name these scalars, denoted lambda, that for a matrix 𝐴
satisfy 𝐴v = 𝜆v [“A v equals lambda v”] where v is their corresponding eigenvector [“eye-gun-vector”].
Answer: eigenvalues [“eye-gun-values”]

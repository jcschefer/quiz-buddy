1. To explain the ice ages, this scientist proposed that the geometric increase of CO2 [“C-O-two”] caused
atmospheric temperature to increase arithmetically [air-ith-MET-ik-lee], his namesake greenhouse
theorem. Taking the natural logarithm of this man’s namesake equation and plotting it against
1/T [“one over T ”] gives a plot whose slope is a certain quantity times the ideal gas constant. This
man’s namesake equation contains a pre-exponential factor, and he defined acids as substances that
form hydronium [“high”-DROH-nee-um] ions. Identify this namesake of an equation that relates the
rate constant to e to the power of negative activation energy over RT , a Swedish chemist.

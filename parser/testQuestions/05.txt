3. In the Heck and Suzuki coupling, the palladium catalysts are regenerated with an elimination step
that also is this type of reaction. One reaction of this type reacts a carbonyl [kar-buh-NEEL] with
hydrazine [“HIGH”-druh-zeen] and a base, which results in the formation of nitrogen gas and removal
of the carbonyl. Hydrogenation reactions are a special case of this type of reaction. This type of
reaction shares its name with a quantity that is high for fluorine and low for lithium, and is defined
as the change in voltage when this type of reaction occurs on that species. These reactions lower
a target’s oxidation state. Name this type of reaction that involves the gain of electrons and is the
opposite of oxidation.
Answer: reduction reactions [accept word forms of reduce; prompt on redox reactions or
oxidation-reduction reactions before “lower”]

8. A clamp-shaped protein complex increases the processivity of this event by preventing one enzyme
from dissociating. In bacteria, this process is started at an ori site by a primer. The Meselson–Stahl
experiment showed that this process was semiconservative. Because this process only occurs in the
5′ [“five prime”]-to-3′ [“three prime”] direction, the lagging strand in this process is handled in small
bits as unwinding occurs, producing Okazaki fragments. This process occurs during the S phase
of the cell cycle, and involves the action of DNA polymerase. Name this process that produces an
additional copy of the genome.
Answer: DNA replication [accept answers mentioning DNA and the notion of synthesizing or copying

11. Phase slips allow this phenomenon to occur along with dissipation, and recent studies of this
phenomenon have looked at twisted pockets of electrons in cuprate [KOOP-“rate”]. Following a
discovery of the unconventional type of this phenomenon by Frank Steglich, research by Bednorz
and Müller uncovered examples with higher critical temperatures. In the conventional types of the
materials in which this phenomenon occurs, electrons interact with phonons [FOH-nahnz] to form
Cooper pairs, whose behavior is explained by BCS theory. Materials that have this property expel
their magnetic fields, which is a display of the Meissner eﬀect. Name this phenomenon in which

12. This operation can be performed on complex functions by increasing the power in the denominator
of Cauchy’s integral formula. This operation is generalized to higher dimensions by the del operator,
which in turn is used to express the directional type of this operation, or curl, or divergence. Under
appropriate conditions, Rolle’s theorem guarantees the existence of a point at which this operation
gives zero; such points, which may be minima or maxima, are called critical points. This operation
can be performed using the quotient rule or the chain rule. Name this operation used to find the

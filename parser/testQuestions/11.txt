1. The Drude [DROO-duh] and free electron models model the behavior of electrons as if they were
one of these substances. The internal energy of one of these substances is only dependent on
temperature, according to Joule’s [“jewel’s”] second law. These substances have a compressibility
factor of one, and monatomic [mahn-uh-TAH-mik] ones have a heat capacity of 3/2 [“three halves”]
at constant volume. Substances tend to act more like these with higher temperature and lower
pressure, when intermolecular forces are weaker. The namesake constant of these substances is
roughly 8.314 joules per mole-kelvin. Identify these substances whose namesake equation states that
P V = nRT , and which are used to model a certain phase of matter.
Answer: ideal gases [prompt on gases]

2. After this battle, the “Lion’s Mound” was constructed on the site where a future William II was
wounded in it. The day before this battle, there was a short cavalry skirmish at Genappe [zheh-nap]

losing leader attempted to flee to the United States but instead surrendered aboard the HMS
Bellerophon. This battle was fought shortly after the Battle of Quatre Bras [kwat-ruh brah] and
was the last battle for Michel Ney [mee-shel neh]. Identify this 1815 battle fought in what is now

5. In 2014, University of Queensland researchers used two of these particles to simulate time travel.
Blackbody radiation can be explained using a gas made up of these particles. Arthur Compton verified
that these particles have momentum, and these particles lose energy during Compton scattering.
Albert Einstein hypothesized the existence of these particles to explain electron emission. These
particles are represented by the letter gamma because they make up gamma rays, and they are also
the components of microwaves and X-rays. Name these carriers of the electromagnetic force, the
quanta of light.
Answer: photons

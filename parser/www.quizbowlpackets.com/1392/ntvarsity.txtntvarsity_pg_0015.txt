Tossup 10: Science (Biology) - Computational (30 Seconds) 
An established colony of flying purple people-eaters is sampled, and it is foundthat 16% have two 
horns. A researcher wants to know how many are homozygousfor the one-horned trait. If the 
population is at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and two-hornedness is a recessive alele (uh-LEEL), 
then 16% mustbe homozygous recessive, and the number of homozygous dominantcan be found 
bysquaring the dominant alele frequency. What percentage of people-eaters are homozygous one-
horned? 
Answer: 36%

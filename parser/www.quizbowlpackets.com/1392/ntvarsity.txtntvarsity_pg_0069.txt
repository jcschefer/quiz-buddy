Georgia, was aborted after his relations soured with the commisioners. This project, however, 
helped him develop certain important techniques, like the useof a large lantern to project a sketch 
onto the rock face on which he worked. His mostfamous project was thought up by Doane 
Robinson, and he died before finishing it, leaving his son Lincoln to direct the rest of its sculpting. 
Name this sculptor most famous for large-scale public memorials, especialy Mount Rushmore.

Tossup 20: Social Studies (Other) 
Hamilton's rule states that you're more likely to exhibit ittoward peopleyou're closely related to, 
because everyone justwants to propagate their own genes anyway. Coined byAuguste Comte,

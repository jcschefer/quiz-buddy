Tossup 10: Science (Physics) 
For it to occur, the Coulomb barier must be overcome so that nuclei come within one femtometer, at 
which point the strong interaction can overcome electromagnetic repulsion.This requires so much 
energythat it can probably only happenat very high temperatures,though some have claimed to 
observe it at room temperature. Usualy occuringwith hydrogen, it is also undergone by helium and 
even lithium.Name this nuclear process in which nuclei combine.

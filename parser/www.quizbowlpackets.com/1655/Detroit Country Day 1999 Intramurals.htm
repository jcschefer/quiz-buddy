longtime reading of &#8220;Mad&#8221; Magazine. Originally called Nature&#8217;s Way, it would

<P>
<P>CHIEF JUSTICE of the United States 
<P>
<P>Some people believe in God and some don&#8217;t. God may or may not exist. Those 
who believe in a God who does not exist are risking finite loss. Those who do

to believe in God. For 15 points, what theological argument have I just 
outlined?

<P>
<P>These four words were made famous by a character whose real name was &#8220;Yev

<P>
<P>&#8220;A woman giving the name of Mrs. James Jones, who is reported to be one of 
the society leaders of the city, is said to have given what purported to be a 
party yesterday to a number of alleged ladies.&#8221; This journalistic gem came from

spoken by the attacking general at this battle, who led 130,000 men against 
Lee&#8217;s forces in late April in 1863. The Union strategy was a three-pronged 
attack, with the aforementioned Joe Hooker leading 70,000 troops across the 
Rapahannock River, nine miles west of Fredricksburg. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, 
however, foiled the attempt with their famous &#8220;cracker barrel&#8221; conference. For

last years. For 15 points, name this Anglo-Irish satirist, clergyman, and 
author, who wrote the biting &#8220;A Modest Proposal&#8221; and is most famous for

<P>
<P>LOLITA 
<P>
<P>He returned to Rome in 62 B.C., having defeated the Mediterranean pirates and 
King Mithridates of Pontus, and having annexed Syria and Palestine. The Senate,

points, name this man who, with Crassus and Julius Caesar, was a member of the 
First Triumverate. 
<P>
<P>POMPEY the Great, or Gnaeus POMPEIUS Magnus 
<P>
<P>Not much is known of this man, with little but the summary of Procleus to 
guide historians. His lifespan is unknown, though Procleus seems sure of the

modern times. 
<P>

their birth in Pieria, sometimes considered on the slopes of Mount Olympus. For 
15 points, name this group of nine inspirers and performers, including 
Terpshichore, Clio, and Calliope. 
<P>
<P>The MUSES

title. 
<P>
<P>BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES

<P>One of the most famous discoveries in recent years was made at 
Super-Kamiokande in Japan. Twelve and a half million gallons of ultra-pure water 
were lined with stainless steel. Cosmic rays and other interference were

costly mistake as he underestimated the Confederates&#8217; strength. The Confederates

were over, 24,000 men had been killed. For 10 points, name this battle named 
after a church.

formed? 
<P>
<P>The RED CROSS 
<P>
<P>Much of his fame was gained by simply walking through the streets, attempting

the youth. For 15 points, name this philosopher. 
<P>
<P>SOCRATES 
<P>
<P>It claims that X is a &#8220;needless letter&#8221; in our alphabet and words beginning 
with X are &#8220;Grecian and will not be defined in this standard english 
dictionary.&#8221; Of course, this would be most nontraditional in a standard 
dictionary, but this 1911 tome is far from one, containing, as H. L. Mencken 
said, &#8220;some of the most gorgeous witticisms in the English language.&#8221; For 15 
points, name this book, originally titled &#8220;The Cynic&#8217;s Word Book,&#8221; by author 
Ambrose Bierce. 
<P>
<P>The DEVIL&#8217;S DICTIONARY 
<P>
<P>This algebraic, irrational number, twice the cosine of pi over five, can be 
expressed as a continued fraction using only the digit one, and adding one to 
this number gives the same result as squaring it. Its applications reach into 
architecture, as the Parthenon is a famous representation of this number, 
usually used as a fraction. For 10 points, name this ratio, approximately equal 
to 1.618. 
<P>
<P>GOLDEN Ratio / Mean / Proportion / Etc.

carried out in one day. For 15 points, name the filthy place through which 
Hercules diverted the aforementioned rivers. 
<P>
<P>AUGEAN STABLES 
<P>
<P>This 14-letter noun retains much of its modern usage from actions on the part 
of the Bohemian Protestants. In May 1618, the eve of the Thirty Years&#8217; War, 
their church was destroyed, and the grew so enraged that they rioted. By the end 
of the riot, it had happened to two of the emperor&#8217;s offials, causing the

defined as the act of being thrown out of a window? 
<P>
<P>DEFENESTRATION (Accept Defenestration of Prague)

the ocean. For 15 points, name this Kurt Vonnegut novel, which is not about a 
string game. 
<P>
<P>CAT&#8217;S CRADLE 
<P>
<P>A sixteen-foot statue stood atop a 24-foot cylindrical section, which stood 
atop a ninety-foot octagonal section, which stood atop a 183-foot cylindrical 
section. At night, a fire in its base was reflected by large mirrors, producing 
a source of light said to be visible thirty to forty miles out on the 
Mediterranean. For 15 points, name this ancient Wonder of the World. 
<P>
<P>The LIGHTHOUSE of ALEXANDRIA (accept Pharos) 
<P>
<P>Upon graduating from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1908, he became a 
professor in physics there. As he was recovering from his tuberculosis six years 
later, he was awarded the first two of his 214 patents. Both patents were for 
versions of a particular object that would make his famous; one was powered by 
liquid fuel. For 15 points, name this pioneer in rocketry. 
<P>
<P>Charles GODDARD 
<P>
<P>Perhaps her most famous work pictures a large, triangular table, around which 
39 famous women sit. This work, &#8220;The Dinner Party,&#8221; helped her become regarded 
as one of the foremost faminist painters in her time. She shares her last name 
with a large city. For 10 points, name the painter or the city on Lake Michigan 
which saw the Daly political machine, and still contains the tallest building in 
the United States. 
<P>
<P>Judy CHICAGO 
<P>
<P>This word dates from the Pythagoreans, who used rocks in their 
representations. Thus it obtained the Latin word for pebble, evidenced in this 
word&#8217;s medical homonym. It also has another usage more closely related to the 
Pythagoreans, but disputes arise when attributing its origin. Some say 
Archimedes invented it while attempting to find an area. More commonly, 
Gottfried Leibniz and Issac Newton are given credit for inventing it. For 15 
points, what is this branch of mathematics, whose basic concept is the limit? 
<P>
<P>CALCULUS 
<P>
<P>He personally shaved his nobles as part of his attempt to obliterate what he 
saw as his nation&#8217;s backwards customs; all others, except clergy and peasantry, 
were also forced to shave their beards. Jointly ruling until 1689, all six feet 
and seven inches of his took sole control of the czarship from then until his 
death in 1725. For 10 points, name this Russian westernizer. 
<P>
<P>PETER the GREAT (accept PETER I) 
<P>
<P>Because the parasite responsible for malaria cannot live in the affected 
cells, it is actually an advantage for some in Africa, where as much as 40% of 
the population might have it. In America, about nine percent of 
African-Americans carry the codominant allele. Sufferers have impaired oxygen 
flow, eventually leading to fatigue, cramps, and organ failure. For 10 points, 
name this genetic disorder, named because it causes cells to clump together in a 
distinctive shape. 
<P>
<P>SICKLE-CELL ANEMIA (accept sickle-cell disease) 
<P>
<P>There were eighteen models in four series, with sich innovations as vertical 
grilles and push-button gears, and they were powered by a 10 million dollar ad

being offered to state highway officials at a discount just to get them on the 
road. For 10 points, name this Ford lemon. 
<P>
<P>Ford EDSEL

color, for the entire piece. For 10 points, name this most famous piece of 
Maurice Ravel. 
<P>
<P>The BOLERO 
<P>
<P>It made perfect sense to Georg Ernst Stahl, who built on the work of Johann 
Joachim Becher. Metals were composed of two things: calx and the namesake 
component. Calx had positive weight, but this had negative weight, which 
accounted for weight changes upon burning. It was disproven in the late 
eighteenth century by Antoine Lavoisier, who discovered much about oxygen and 
combustion in the process. For 10 points, name this obsolete chemical theory. 
<P>
<P>PHLOGISTON 
<P>
<P>It can be either profundo, cantante, or buffo, the latter being clear and 
deep and often used in comic roles. This voice range is often used for such 
roles as Boris Gudonov and Mephistopheles, and not surprisingly so. For 10 
points, name this lowest male voice range. 
<P>
<P>BASS 
<P>
<P>First, prove the continuum hypothesis. Seventh, obtain axioms for 
mathematical physics. Eighth, in part, prove the Riemann hypothesis. Fifteenth,

variations. These were among a set of mathematical challenges handed down in 
Paris in 1900. For 10 points, who proposed them? 
<P>
<P>David HILBERT

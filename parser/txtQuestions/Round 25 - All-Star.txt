PACE NSC 2015 - Round 25 - ALL STAR GAME - Tossups
1. In reduced units, the operator for this quantity for the hydrogen atom is often expressed as one over the
radius minus one half del-squared. For a particle in a box, the average value of this quantity is the integral
of psi-star times the Hamiltonian of psi, and is minimized at h squared over eight times the mass times
the length squared. This quantity does not commute with time, in a common expression of the
uncertainty principle. (*) Degeneracy occurs for two states where this quantity is the same. H psi equals this
quantity times psi, according to the time-independent Schrodinger equation. For 10 points, name this quantity that
is quantized by Planck's constant, and which is measured in electron-volts or Joules.
ANSWER: energy [or total energy; or E; or kinetic energy; or Hamiltonian until it is read] <Silverman>
2. Handel's Messiah plays as paupers break into a house and recreate Da Vinci's Last Supper in a film by
this director, in which Don Jaime plans to rape the title novice. Another film by this man opens with the
Hebrides Overture playing over a documentary about scorpions and ends with the Duc de Blangis
emerging beardless from a door in a scene inspired by 120 Days of Sodom. In that film, a woman sucks the
toes of a religious (*) statue. This director of Viridiana collaborated with a painter on a film in which Pierre
Batcheff bicycles in a nun's habit and pulls two pianos bearing two priests and dead donkeys. That film opens with a
woman's eye being sliced open with a razor. For 10 points, name this Spanish surrealist director of L'Age d'Or and
Un Chien Andalou.

3. In a poem often attributed to this person, a tomb containing the talking corpse of an ancient judge is
unearthed during the building of a cathedral. A story about idle workers in a vineyard is told to the speaker
of a poem by this author after he falls asleep and sees his deceased daughter across a river. Another poem
by this man depicts hunts for deer, a boar, and a fox, whose carcasses are traded for kisses with a man
who hides a green girdle he receives from the wife of (*) Bertilak. All of this poet's extant works, including
Cleanness and Patience, are found in the Cotton Nero A.x. ("a"-ten) manuscript. For 10 points, name this
anonymous author usually named for his poem about the title gem or for his poem in which a man enters a
beheading game with a green knight.
ANSWER: the Pearl Poet [or the Gawain Poet] <Brownstein>
4. In chronic forms of this disease, the infected cells take on a "ground glass" appearance. It's not HIVAIDS, but during the "window period" of this disease, screens will be negative for the causative agent's
surface antigens, but may turn up IgM and IgG antibodies to its core antigen. This is the more common
disease whose causative agent gains entry to a cell by binding to NTCP, or sodium/bile acid
cotransporter. This disease is caused by an unusual, partially double-stranded DNA virus. The chronic
form of this disease, for which there is a vaccine, can lead to (*) cirrhosis and liver cancer. For 10 points, name
this form of hepatitis that infects roughly a third of the world's population.

sole affiliated seminary is a rabbinical college in Wyncote, Pennsylvania. In 1945, the Sabbath Prayer Book
published by this denomination was publicly burned. The founder of this denomination taught Ira
Eisenstein, created the (*) bat mitzvah ceremony, and had his daughter Judith undergo the very first one. This

15. A set of works produced in this sort of place claims that "traditional" intellectuals serve the State while
"organic" intellectuals arise in every social class. An account of "cultural hegemony" was put forward in

20. If n is one of these numbers, the only odd numbers in the nth row of Pascal's triangle are the ones at
the ends. One can tell whether a non-increasing non-negative series a-sub-n converges by looking at its
values when n is one of these numbers, according to Cauchy's condensation test. The only currently
known perfect numbers can each be written as a large prime times one of these numbers. The size of the

21. In Drosophila, the P element transposon effects the "insertional" type of this process. A population's
expected heterozygosity depends on population size and the rate of this process. Two types of this process
are notated using a greater than sign and an uppercase delta. This process is called "dominant negative"
if the product antagonizes the (*) wild-type. Muller's ratchet explains that populations reproducing asexually
experience deleterious forms of this process way more than populations reproducing sexually. Silent, missense, and
nonsense forms make up the "point" type of this process, and insertions and deletions comprise the more serious
"frameshift" form. For 10 points, name these permanent changes in the nucleotide sequence of an organism.

nonsense mutation; or point mutation; or frameshift mutation; accept insertions before mentioned; accept

by the moon. This god is victorious in a race around the (*) world when he chooses instead to run around his

namesake "miniscule." The Spanish Marches were set up as a buffer zone by a ruler of this dynasty who
employed the historian (*) Paul the Deacon. Two rulers of this dynasty exchanged the Oaths of Strasbourg,

existence of an underground postal service called Trystero. Its protagonist travels to San Narciso after being named
executor of Pierce Inverarity's estate. For 10 points, name this postmodern tale about Oedipa Maas, the shortest

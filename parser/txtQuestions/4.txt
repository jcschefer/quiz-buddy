Tossups
1. This man was targeted by Humphrey de Bohun in the Remonstrances after he attempted to annex
Flanders. One person who opposed this man heroically defended Caernarfon Castle before being
routed in Powys; that man was Llywelyn the Last. He issued a decree outlawing the charging of
interest, followed fifteen years later by an Edict of Expulsion banishing all (*) Jews from England.
This monarch was opposed by a man who was supported by Andrew Moray. As a result, this king’s
general, the Earl of Surrey, was crushed at Stirling Bridge. This man commanded the winning forces at the
battle of Evesham against Simon de Montfort on behalf of his father, Henry II. For 10 points, identify this
king who faced the revolt of William Wallace, a Plantagenet nicknamed "Longshanks".

2. Most knowledge of this work’s premiere comes from the firsthand account of Friedrich Bonet. A
plaintive oboe carries the melody in a movement of this work oddly marked “Adagio e staccato.”

3. Frank Jackson posited the idea of a super-scientist who knows everything about these entities
without ever perceiving them in his “Mary’s Room” experiment. Goodman’s New Riddle of
Induction posits a group of objects that change this property at a set time, blending their names

textbook example of falsifiablity involves asking whether all swans have the same value for this
property. In Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Hume uses one to show that ideas arise
independent of experience by imagining a (*) missing one. For 10 points, name these qualities, which
physicalists would say are simply expressions of the wavelength of light bouncing off an object.
ANSWER: colors [accept more specific answers like blue or green]

4. This poet wrote of "Dark river-beds where the eternal thirst flows/ and weariness follows, and the
infinite ache" and addressed a "white bee" that "[buzzes] in my soul, drunk with honey." Another

Punitaqui." W.S. Merwin translated a collection by this author that includes the poem "Ah Vastness

Democratic National Convention in St. Louis. Two organizations that supported this cause were
merged into the (*) NAWSA. A group of supporters of this cause had a convention in Akron, Ohio, during
which Sojourner Truth gave a notable speech. Wyoming was the first state to grant this right. This cause
was realized when Tennessee ratified the Nineteenth Amendment. For 10 points, name this cause,
advocated by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.

they are full of disordered desires. This man argued that immoral behavior was punishment from
God and original sin resulted from Adam and Eve's pride and foolishness in his Against the Pelagians
. This man denounced (*) Rome and Platonism in a work that claims the sinful society of men obscures
the true kingdom of God, and his work served as the basis for Aquinas' formulation of just war. Another

10. At the critical point, this equation predicts a compressibility of three-eights. The critical
exponents predicted by this equation are identical to those predicted by the Ising model, placing it in
the universality class of mean field theories. It is derived using the hard-sphere potential. Around
phase transitions, it incorrectly predicts oscillatory isotherms. This equation can be derived by
truncating the virial expansion at two (*) terms. One constant in this equation accounts for the excluded

spy Afranius and the soldier Mark the Ratkiller. Its twelfth chapter is set at the Variety Theater,
where a shower of money and piles of expensive clothes are produced by Fagot, only to disappear
later. It opens at Patriarch's Ponds, where the head of (*) MASSOLIT is beheaded by a streetcar. In an
insane aslyum, the poet Ivan Bezdomny meets this novel's first title character, who has written a manuscript

external expectations create multiple equilibrium points for it according to Peter Diamond's Coconut
Model. The Shapiro-Stiglitz model implies that efficiency wages sustain this phenomenon, which is
similarly maintained according to the NAIRU model developed by Phelps and Friedman. Okun's law
posits the (*) inverse relationship between this and GDP, while the Beveridge Curve is particularly useful
in modeling a type of this phenomenon created by mismatched conditions, its “frictional” form. The
Phillips Curve plots inflation against, for 10 points, what economic phenomenon in which laborers are out

17. One law governing these entities is derived by applying Bose-Einstein statistics to a photon gas in
a cavity, and predicts an energy dependence proportional to the negative fifth power of wavelength.
The cosmic microwave background approximates the continuous spectrum of these objects. Applying
classical physics to one of these objects gives a law that states that their energy spectrum diverges to
infinity at high frequency. A constant of 5.67 times 10 to the negative 8 relates the (*) emissivity of
these objects to the fourth power of temperature. Planck’s Law replaced that law named for Rayleigh and
Jeans, and the Stefan-Boltzmann law also applies to them. For 10 points, identify these ideal objects which

putting it in order. There are “quick”, “insertion”, and “bogo” algorithms for performing this operation.
ANSWER: sorting
[10] This type of recursive sort involves dividing a list into two approximate halves recursively and
combining the two sorted sub-lists into one big sorted list.
ANSWER: merge sort
[10] Mergesort, quicksort, and heapsort all have a best case runtime and average case runtime of big O of
this function.
ANSWER: n log n

18. Sulfur hexafluoride adopts this molecular geometry, which is susceptible to the one axis lengthening
due to degeneracy in the Jahn-Teller effect. For 10 points each:
[10] Identify this molecular geometry which is adopted by atoms that have six ligands surrounding one
central atom with no lone pairs.
ANSWER: octahedral
[10] The octahedral configuration contains bonding electrons in these orbitals, which can hold 10 electrons
total. Transition metals have electrons in these orbitals.
ANSWER: d orbitals
[10] This theory predicts that ligands in octahedral complexes split d orbitals into two groups, e sub g and t
sub 2g. It is very accurate in predicting the color of octahedral complexes as transitions between those
groups.
ANSWER: crystal field theory [or CFT; accept ligand field theory or LFT]

this specific substance to be clear and distinct, despite that all of its physical attributes can totally change.

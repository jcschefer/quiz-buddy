1. For the Lane-Emden equation, having a polytropic index take on this value appropriately models a
stable, isothermally stratified atmosphere. This is the value in time at which the rate of expansion
becomes zero if the density equals the critical density. When considering the Schwarzschild solution to the
Field Equations, the curvature takes on this value when there is no radius. When calculating the escape
velocity, this is the value that the distance takes on at the (*) final time. The luminosity of any point in a
steady-state universe takes on this value according to the scenario analyzed in Olber's Paradox. As one approaches a
singularity, this is the amount of force needed to maintain a particle in place. For 10 points, name this value at
which things become immeasurably big.
ANSWER: infinite [or infinity] <Jose>
2. A character in this short story attempts to make a portrait on a plate of metal, but he throws the metal
into a jar of acid when it comes out "blurred and indefinable." Another character in this story is unable to
forget hearing the words "It is in her heart now; we must have it out!", which her husband had spoken
aloud while dreaming. Late in this story, the "yellow blotches" on a geranium are (*) removed by a potion
prepared with the assistance of Aminadab, which unfortunately for its inventor causes the death of his wife
Georgiana. For 10 points, name this Nathaniel Hawthorne short story about Aylmer, who tries to remove the title
imperfection, shaped like a small crimson hand, from his wife's cheek.
ANSWER: "The Birthmark" <Gehring>
3. This king made a politically-expedient pilgrimage to Rome to attend the coronation of Conrad II. This
man used a dispute over a chess game as a pretext to kill his rebellious brother-in-law Ulf. This king
legendarily set his throne up by a seashore and fruitlessly commanded the tides not to wet his robes to
prove he had less power than God. This man's first wife Aelfgifu proved to be an unbearably autocratic
ruler of (*) Norway. After winning the Battle of Assandun against Edmund Ironside, this king married Aethelred
the Unready's widow Emma of Normandy, and soon ruled all of England. This king's son had a name prefixing his
with "Hartha." For 10 points, name this son of Sweyn Forkbeard, a powerful king who ruled both Denmark and
England from 1018 to 1035.

recent authors define Wicksell's "natural" version of this as the value at which GDP equals potential GDP.
On the IS-LM diagram, this value must decrease as output increases in order for investment and savings
to be in equilibrium. Paul Krugman has criticized the Federal Reserve's zero lower bound policies where
this value is (*) left very close to nothing. The Taylor Rule suggests how a central bank can raise or lower this
value to control inflation. The virtual inability of this value to go below zero can lead to a liquidity trap, when
people hoard cash rather than invest by loaning it to others. For 10 points, name this rate that is the cost of
borrowing money.
ANSWER: interest rate <Bailey>

these buildings shaped like a tent and surrounded by four obelisk-shaped towers. The largest adobe
building in the world is one of these structures in (*) Djenne, Mali. The grandest Ottoman versions of these

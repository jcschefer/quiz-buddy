which increases cyclic AMP, which in turn activates protein
kinase A [KIH-nase A]. This hormone stimulates a process

If the cosine of theta is seven ninths, this is the value of
the sine of the quantity theta over two. In this problem,
you should assume that the angle is in the first
quadrant, so you only need to give the positive possible
answer.
If the sine of theta is twelve thirteenths, and the cosine
of theta is five thirteenths, this is the value of the
tangent of theta over two. In this problem, you already
know that the angle is in the first quadrant, so you
should only give the positive answer.
The tangent of theta over two can be evaluated by
subtracting this function from the cosecant

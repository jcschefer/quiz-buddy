2. Owing in part to his failed experiment of mixing tempera and oil paints, this artist never completed a

"course-of-values" for functions. The failure of that "Basic Law" of this number by Gottlob Frege
inspired Russell's paradox. As initially proposed by Philippa Foot, this is the number of people who would
be saved if the switch is flipped in the "trolley problem." A famous set of this many arguments includes an
argument from degree, an argument for a (*) "first cause," and a teleological argument. This many "Ways" of
proving God's existence were proposed by Thomas Aquinas. Plato's Timaeus defines aether as the classical element
of this number. For 10 points, give the number used since Aristotle for the number of senses humans have.

not easily angered" and "keeps no record of wrongs." This book controversially instructs women to (*)
cover their heads in worship, and describes putting the "ways of childhood behind me" after becoming a man.
Chapter 13 of this book describes a concept that "does not envy, does not boast," and notes that "Love is patient,
love is kind." For 10 points, name this Pauline epistle, the first of two addressed to a church in Greece.
ANSWER: First Corinthians [or 1 Corinthians; prompt on Corinthians] <Kim>
8. The protagonist of this novel is the title subject of a 2013 "Counter-Investigation" by Kamel Daoud.
Near the end of this novel, the protagonist answers affirmatively to the question "Do you really live with
the thought that when you die, you die, and nothing remains?" posed to him by the Chaplain. On a "night
alive with sand and stars", this novel's protagonist opens himself "to the gentle (*) indifference of the

equals proton affinity plus electron affinity minus ionization energy. It is exactly equal to the heat of
reaction for homolysis, forming radicals. Though not heat of formation, this quantity is quite low for
peroxides, explaining their (*) explosiveness. The heat of reaction equals the sum over this quantity for each of
the reactants minus the sum of it for the products. It varies inversely with length and directly with order. For 10
points, name this quantity, the amount of energy released when two molecular fragments link covalently.

10. In this non-science area of study, category members are organized around a core of most

11. The Lorenz number, equal to 2.4 times ten to the negative eighth, appears in the empirical
Wiedemann-Franz Law for these materials. A classical model of these materials proposes a constant drift
velocity from a uniform field and elastic electronic collisions. Sommerfeld adapted the Drude model of
these materials into his free-electron model. Cold work prevents the movement of dislocations in these
materials, resulting in strain hardening. Sequences of (*) quenching, then tempering, are used to strengthen
these materials. Crystal lattices model the microstructure of these materials, which have delocalized "seas" of
electrons. As a result, they have high conductivity, and are ductile and malleable. For 10 points, name these
materials that are mixed in alloys.
ANSWER: metals [prompt on conductors or crystal lattices] <Silverman>
12. Elector John George II of Saxony refused the crown of Bohemia because taking it would have
interfered with his participation this activity. Count Gaston III of Foix-Bearn wrote a popular medieval

14. The coefficients of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind can be found using identities involving this
function. This function of a complex number z is the arithmetic mean of e to the i times z and that
exponential's reciprocal. This function is on the main diagonal of a two-dimensional rotation matrix. A
complex number's magnitude times this function of its argument yields its (*) real part. This even function
is equal to its own fourth derivative, and its Taylor expansion begins 1 minus x-squared over 2. c-squared equals asquared plus b-squared minus 2 a b times this function of angle C, according to its namesake law in triangles. For 10
points, identify this trigonometric function, which for an angle in a right triangle equals adjacent over hypotenuse.

theory satirized as an attempt to "sap and impurify" the "precious bodily fluids" of Americans in Dr.

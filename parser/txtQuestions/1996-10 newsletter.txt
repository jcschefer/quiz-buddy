QUIZ BOWL ON THE INTERNET
by Ken Brandt, Vanguard High School, Ocala, Florida

Academic teams, competitions, contact information, and even questions can now be found
on the Internet. Right now, the focus seems to be on the World Wide Web.
All of these sites were "up and running" as of this writing. The easiest way to find the
teams which have a web page is to use the Yahoo search engine, and type in "academic
quiz bowl" at the search prompt. Yahoo's address is www.yahoo.com (all web addresses
begin with http://) .
Two competition companies which have set up shop on the web are Questions Unlimited
and Academic's Up! Questions Unlimited is run by Chip Beall and offers on-line contests
through America Online and, new this year, on the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) network.
Friendly advice: Don't read the full index ofIRC channels unliess obscenities do not
offend you. Web address - www.qunlimited.com
Academic's Up! is running downloadable multiple choice competitions (3 per semester).
Web address - www.inetw.netl-academicl
The unofficial college bowl archive is the gateway to all kinds of goodies,' from web
addresses of college teams to many packets of downloadable questions which have been
used in college-level competition over the past five years, to question-writing guidelines
and a listing of high school tournaments sponsored by college teams. You can add
yourself to their distribution list. Web address - www.papyrus-inc.comlcollege_bowl?
See you on the 'net!!!
Ken Brandt is President of the Florida Academic Association of Teams and Coaches, the "Grand hlquisitor" of
Academic's Up! and coach of the Vanguard (Ocala, Florida) Academic Te8l11. You can e-mail him at

NATIONAL ACADEMIC CHAMPIONSHIP
With 125 teams competing, the National Academic Championship remains the nation's
largest and oldest national high school quiz bowl tournament.
For the second year, tournament founder Charles "Chip" Beall hosted a two-phase, two
weekend tournament on college campuses - Loyola University (New Orleans, LA) and
Marymount University (Arlington, VA). The top two teams from the first phase then
completed in the final rounds of the second.
Top-seeded in new Orleans was the defending national champion Governor's School
(Richmond, VA), captained by 1996 "Teen Jeopardy" winner Amanda Goad, and secondseed went to Memorial High School of Houston, Texas which had lost an early
preliminary match to 1995 and 1996 "Tournament of Champions" winner Edmond
Memorial of Oklahoma. 路路The top.!Wo teams in Arlington were both from Pennsylvania Manheim Township路 and Downingtown.
In the semifinals, Houston Memorial defeated Downingtown, 455 - 175, and the
Governor's School edged Manheim Township, 425 - 405, to set up a championship match
between the top-seeded teams from the New Orleans phase of the tournament.
In a close championship match, once-defeated Houston Memorial came from behind in the
final minutes to upset No.1 Governor's School, 370 - 325. Congratulations to first-time
winner Memorial High School of Houston, Texas and their coach, Dorothy Blodgett!

FUND-RAISING POSSIBILITIES FOR QUIZ BOWL
by Regina Allen

Lack of funds is a problem inherent in many school systems. Traditional programs such as
spons se~m at times to gain the lion's share of funding for extra-curricular activities.
Scholar bowl organizations are many times left to their own resourcefulness to raise funds.
This calls for some inventive brain-storming. There are some traditional money-makers
which seem to be the most tried and true. Borrowing from our athletic cousins, the
Booster Club is always a way to encourage parental involvement and gain funds at the
same time. Many academic boosters not only suppon scholar bowl but also other
academic organizations such as Math competitions, debate clubs, and language clubs.

If a booster club is not a possibility, the academic team may have to take matters into its
own hands. Fund-raising ideas are only as limited as your own imagination. Bake sales,
rummage sales, candy sales, and so on are always among the usual choices. However,
with other organizations vying for the same piece of the financial pie, new ideas must be
spawned. Approaching the holiday seasons with service oriented fund-raisers might swell
your coffers. For example, offering to wrap Christmas gifts would be a welcome
assistBl!ce to weary shoppers. The fall season offers opportunities for haunted houses,
selling pumpkins, and fall festivals. In the spring, car washes are always a good choice.
Holding an invitational quiz bowl tournament is a fund-raising technique unique to this
type of activity. When holding a tournament, a little experience is very helpful. Rules,
questions, location, moderators, and personnel are all obstacles that must be overcome.
You can rely on your own team to fill many of these roles or ask others who have held
tournaments for their suggestions.
One other avenue which might be explored is the possibility of sponsorship. Such
organizations as the Rotary Club, the Masons, the Kiwanis, the Elks, and others often
support academic causes. Check in your community for these resources.
Talk to elected officials and members of your school board for their ideas.
The road to fund-raising is never easy but options do exist in this complex financial
environment.

If you need to use a replacement question, use the attached sheet and its instructions to determine the correct one to read.
26. Stars can appear to be brighter at their poles in this phenomenon’s namesake darkening. The Eötvös experiment
concerned this force, whose balancing point with outward radiation is the Eddington limit. Its namesake waves were
reported by Hulse and Taylor, and its namesake constant was first measured using a torsion balance by Cavendish.
General relativity has supplanted Newton’s model of this force, which treated it as an inverse-square phenomenon.
With its namesake acceleration on earth about equal to 9.81 meters per second squared, name this weakest fundamental force, which is exclusively attractive and acts between objects with mass.
ANSWER: gravity [or gravitation, etc.; accept gravity brightening or gravity darkening]
27. The probability distribution of phenotypes is part of Hartl’s definition of this concept, and an altruistic act must
increase this quantity to pass Hamilton’s rule. The inclusive variety of this explains why worker bees care for their sisters, and when most alleles are neutral for this quantity, genetic drift overtakes natural selection. Most courtship behavior is driven by the relative type of this quantity, for which mules rate a zero. Generally decreased by inbreeding
and increased by adaptability, identify this evolutionary measure of reproductive success, the contribution of an individual to the gene pool of the next generation, which usually goes up the longer an individual survives.
ANSWER: Darwinian fitness [or adaptive value; or selective value]
28. The first biological role for this element was discovered in 2000 when it was found in the carbonic anhydrase enzyme of marine diatoms, and the first spectroscopic definition of the meter was based on this element’s red line. Along
with bismuth, lead, and tin, this element comprises the alloy known as Wood’s metal, and it is the only element in
Group 12 that can form complex ions with chloride. The only ore mineral with this element is greenockite. This metal
is the basis for the highest-grade yellow pigment, but its ingestion causes itai-itai disease, which includes severe osteoporosis. Combined with nickel in most rechargeable batteries, identify this transition metal with atomic number 48
and symbol Cd.
ANSWER: cadmium [accept Cd before the end]
29. These geologic structures can be distinguished from similar phenomena because they lack a central canal, and calcite pearls often grow under conditions that do not support the formation of these structures. Rare basalt examples of
these structures fill a chamber in Iceland’s Arnahellir lava tube, while the ice-type is common in mines where temperatures are markedly higher at the ceiling than the floor. Most of these structures occur in karst topology, like the Hall
of Giants and Witch’s Finger in Carlsbad Caverns, and they are the only dripstone formations that cannot collapse
under their own weight. Name these structures that grow from the dripping of calcium carbonate-rich water onto the
floor of a limestone cave, sometimes forming the bottom half of a column with a neighboring stalactite.
ANSWER: stalagmite [do not accept or prompt on “stalactite”]

30. This point is collinear with the Nagel Point, incenter, and Spieker center. It is always twice as far from the orthocenter as from the circumcenter, and it is collinear with those points together with the nine-point circle center. Its
barycentric coordinates never change, and it always is located in the interior of the triangle. This point is a point of
concurrency of three cevians (CHAY-vee-uns), and the ratio of each of the smaller segments of those cevians to point
of concurrency is 2 to 1. If a triangle is made of uniform density, this point is located at the center of mass. Name this
point of intersection of the medians of a triangle.
ANSWER: centroids [prompt on center of mass; prompt on center of gravity]
31. This result can be calculated by taking the inverse of the quantity A transpose A, end quantity, times A transpose
B, where matrix A has a column of ones on its left or right side. That equation finds what is often considered the “optimal” solution to an overdetermined system. The accuracy of this result is measured by the square of the correlation
coefficient, which equals one for perfect linear fits. Name this process of producing a line that approximately goes
through a set of given points.
ANSWER: ordinary linear least-squares regression line [accept either or both parts, or anything containing “regression”; accept line of best-fit; accept OLSRL]
32. This entrepreneur helped start the “No Pass No Play” rule in Texas. A subject of Ken Follett’s On Wings of Eagles, this man hired Arthur “Bull” Simmons to rescue two of his employees from Iran. The first company he started
was sold to GM for over two billion dollars, and the second company he started was sold to Dell for over three billion
dollars. This man’s political career was hampered by his unproven allegations that his opponent planned on using
nude pictures of this man’s daughter and by his selection of James Stockdale. Name this opponent of the first Iraq
War and NAFTA who ran for President in 1992 and 1996 as a third-party candidate.
ANSWER: Henry Ross Perot
33. The best-known example of one of these rulings followed a decree given by the Kingdom of Croatia and the Pactum mutuae successionis of 1703. One of these restored the Decree of 1789, while another one issued in 1438 at
Bourges gave some independence to the Gallican Church from the Roman Church. Defined as a decree which becomes law, it generally refers to decrees given by the Holy Roman Emperor. That best known example failed to prevent the War of Austrian Succession. Name the 1713 ruling by Charles the Sixth that allowed women to rule the
Habsburg Empire.
ANSWER: Pragmatic Sanctions
34. The British were able to establish a presence in this modern-day country because of a dispute between the brothers Tengku Abdul Rahman and Tengku Hussein. Its control by Stamford Raffles was strengthened by the AngloDutch Treaty of 1824. In February 1942, it was taken over by the Japanese, who killed Chinese residents in the Sook
Ching Massacre. A major part of the Straits Settlement under the British Crown, this nation gained self-governance
under Lim Yew Hock in the 1950s and later complete independence under Lee Kuan Yew. Because its Chinese population caused racial tensions, this country was kicked out of Malaysia in 1965. Identify this small island nation.
ANSWER: Republic of Singapore [or Republik Singapura; or Sîn-kâ-phô Khiung-fò-koet; or Xīnjiāpō
Gònghéguó; or Sĭng-gă-pŏ Gê̤ṳng-huò-guók; or Sāngabō Gùngwòhgwok; or Ciṅkappūr Kutiyaracu]

35. This person was accused of breaking the asiento provision of the Treaty of Utrecht, which limited the slave trade
with Spanish colonies. He is responsible for encouraging the fighting that led to King George’s War, giving a dramatic
speech to the House of Commons in 1738, seven years after he was supposed to speak to King George the Second.
While returning to England from Jamaica, his ship was pulled over by the San Antonio, a Spanish Coast Guard ship
also known as the Isabela. While tied to the mast of his own ship, the Rebecca, he had a body part cut off. Name this
sailor who carried around a pickled jar that contained his ear.
ANSWER: Robert Jenkins
36. This playwright wrote a play that takes place in an apartment above Kurnitz’s Kandy Store, where Eddie’s mother
takes care of his sister Bella and his sons Arty and Jay. This writer also completed a trilogy about Eugene Jerome, a
New Yorker who goes through basic training in Mississippi near the end of World War Two before trying to become
a comedy writer. Another one of this writer’s works is about a divorced newswriter named Felix Ungar, who moves in
with sportswriter Oscar Madison. The trilogy consisted of Broadway Bound, Biloxi Blues, and Brighton Beach Memoirs.
Name this writer of Lost in Yonkers and The Odd Couple.
ANSWER: Neil Simon
37. In one book by this author, Meldrum dies of pneumonia and is replaced by Ralston. That novel is set largely at
Mrs. Wickett’s house, where the protagonist reminisces about his former wife Kathie, who died in childbirth, and
teaching Latin at Brookfield Academy. Another book by this author begins with four Englishmen, including a novelist
named Rutherford, talking in Berlin about an airplane that was stolen with four people in it. The four people were
Henry Barnard, Roberta Brinklow, Charles Mallinson, and Hugh Conway, and they were taken to a utopian place in
the Himalayas. Identify this author of Goodbye, Mr. Chips and Lost Horizon.
ANSWER: James Hilton
38. One character in this work exclaims, “It’s astonishing what a number of churches and idiots there are in the
world.” This play opens with Sulla typing dictated letters and a visit from a famous man’s daughter, who gets upset
that all of her sentences are finished for her. Eventually, the life of Alquist is spared because he works with his hands,
and he refers to Primus and Helena as Adam and Eve. A different character named Helena burns important documents, which ends up destroying the human race. Identify this play written in Czech by Karel Čapek.
ANSWER: R.U.R. [or Rossum’s Universal Robots; or Rossumovi univerzální roboti]
39. This work might be based on words spoken to Nikolaus Madruz, and its narrator says that he chooses never to
stoop. This poem ends with a reference to a bronze statue by Claus of Innsbruck which shows Neptune taming a sea
horse. It discusses the joy brought by a white mule or a bough of cherries, which upsets the narrator when those gifts
are put on a par with a nine-hundred-years-old name. This work begins with a reference to a painting supposedly by
Fra Pandolf, which shows the former wife of the narrator, the Duke of Ferrara. Identify this poem by Robert Browning.
ANSWER: “My Last Duchess”

Saint-Lazare railroad station in which the foreground appears in the half of the painting to the right of the green gaslight. Name this artist who showed a man and woman sharing an umbrella in Paris Street; Rainy Day.
ANSWER: Gustave Caillebotte
41. One work by this composer is supposed to end with March for the Presentation of the Colours, but because that part
often is omitted, it ends with Judex crederis, which is called both a hymn and a prayer. Another work, a requiem he was
not paid for until he threatened to spread a rumor about the French government, is his Grande Messe des morts. The
first symphony by this composer, whose sequel is known as Lélio, has its last three of five sections titled Scene in the

ANSWER: Toronto
43. This Greco-Roman god is often identified with the Egyptian god Min. The protector of sailors and fishermen, the
best-known drawing of him is near the entrance of the House of the Vettii in Pompeii. Donkeys were sacrificed to this
god because he killed a donkey that prevented him from raping Lotis. This god was cursed before birth by Hera because she was jealous of his mother Aphrodite, so he was ugly and impotent. Statues of him often were placed next to

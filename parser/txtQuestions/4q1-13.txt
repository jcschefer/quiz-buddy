8. Edward Chace Tolman formulated the "purposive" branch of this school. Another member of this school
wrote Animal Intelligence and researched how cats escaped from puzzle boxes. In addition to Edward
Thorndike, another member of this school conducted the Little Albert experiment and claimed to be able to
train an infant to "become any type of specialist." For 10 points, name this school of psychology associated
with John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner, which attempts to study the actions of animals and humans.
ANSWER: behaviorism

9. By Fubini's theorem, multiple instances of this operator can be performed in any order, and performing it
on a product of functions can be done "by parts." Using the disk or shell methods, one can use this operator
to find the volume of a solid of revolution. First defined rigorously by Bernhard Riemann, this operator can
be described graphically as finding the area under the graph of a function. For 10 points, name this function,
which by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is the inverse function of differentiation.
ANSWER: integration [or integral]

10. A book about a journey on this route was the first bestseller for popular historian Francis Parkman.
Marcus Whitman led the "great migration" along this route. Landmarks on this route included Fort Bridger,
Fort Hall, and Soda Springs. Twelve thousand people used this route to settle in the Columbia River Valley.
This route started at Independence, Missouri and moved westward through Kansas, Nebraska, and
Wyoming, where it shared stretches with the Mormon Trail. For 10 points, identify this settler route to a
namesake Western U.S. territory.

Tiebreaker Questions
1. If an alternate loop structure is present, these entities can terminate early in a process known as
attenuation. The mechanism of their function was discovered by Jacob and Monod. Translational repressors
of these entities contrast with their transcriptional repressors, which bind to the operator site. They also have
promoter sites, where RNA polymerase binds. In E. coli, one of them facilitates the transport and production
of lactose. For 10 points, name these sequences of prokaryotic DNA that regulate expression of related
genes, including the trp (trip) and lac types.
ANSWER: operons

2. This composer's first symphony was originally for organ. Eugene Goossens commissioned a
brass-and-percussion piece by this composer that he would later incorporate into the finale of his Third
Symphony. One of this man's ballets contains the "Hoe-Down" movement. He composed a ballet
choreographed by Martha Graham that incorporates the Shaker hymn "Simple Gifts." For 10 points, name
this American composer of Rodeo, Fanfare for the Common Man, and Appalachian Spring.
ANSWER: Aaron Copland

3. Barriers to entry are one way that existing firms can have the "incumbent" form of this, as compared to
new firms in a market. The ability to produce a good more efficiently in a national economy is its "absolute"
form. Two countries which produce more of two goods by respectively specializing in one and the other are
benefiting from another form of this, which was originally explained in terms of British cloth and
Portuguese wine by David Ricardo. For 10 points, give this economic term that appears in justifications of
international trade in its "comparative" form.
ANSWER: advantage

This is the ratio of the area of an inscribed circle to the area one-half (or 0.5)
of a circumscribed circle for a square. This number is
hypothesized to be the real part of solutions in the Riemann
[REE-mahn] hypothesis. Multiplying this number by a
whole number and one more than that whole number gives a
triangular number. This number equals the cosine of the
quantity pi over three. Raising a number to this power is
equivalent to taking a square root. Give this number that is
multiplied by the base and height of a triangle to find its
area.

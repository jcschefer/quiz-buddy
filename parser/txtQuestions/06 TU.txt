3. This event resulted in an investigation that was hampered by friction between Barbara Bodine and John O’Neill,
and a president deciding not to act because he was tired of swatting at flies. Some people blamed Kirk Lippold, who
had planned on making a refueling stop. While one of its perpetrators, who had previously been involved in arranging
false passports and smuggling missiles, admitted to this attack, the admission was made under torture, so the charges
against him have temporarily been dropped. Seventeen Americans were killed, and many of the perpetrators either
escaped from or were released from Yemen prisons. Name this attack by Al Qaeda on a ship docked at the Port of
Aden on October 12, 2000.
ANSWER: attack on the USS Cole [accept clear knowledge equivalents, including more specific answers like
“bombing of…”, for “attack”]
4. Produced from tryptophan, parenchyma cells are responsible for this compound’s polar transport through
coleoptile tissue. It activates expansins which loosen cellulose microfibrils, in turn causing the target cell to take in
water, according to the acid growth hypothesis. At high concentrations, it stimulates ethylene production, and as
dicots are more sensitive to synthetic ones, it is often used as an herbicide. Responsible for vascular cambium growth
and many tropisms, it is produced in meristem tissue. Name this class of chemicals explained by Frits Went,
responsible for cell elongation in plants—the first plant hormone to be discovered.
ANSWER: auxins

the Bill of Rights against the states by invoking it. This law affirmed the national debt, but disavowed any debt from
rebellions, and allowed a two-thirds vote of Congress to exempt someone from its prohibition on office-holding by
former Confederate sympathizers. This measure also nullified the three-fifths clause, though it excepted “Indians not
taxed”, and established twenty-one as the voting age. This amendment stated that anyone born in the United States is
a citizen, and established equal protection and due process. Name this second of the Reconstruction amendments.
ANSWER: fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution

experiment, he shortened or lengthened a maze, causing animals to hit their heads on the walls. Besides conducting
the Kerplunk experiment, he posited that he could raise any baby to become the perfect doctor or lawyer or thief in
his “Twelve Infants Theory.” Name this American psychologist who ran rats through mazes, in addition to using loud
noises to make an infant fear a white rat in the Little Albert experiment, a founder of Behaviorism.

13. These substances comprise the bottom layer of solar ponds, and they can exist because condensation cannot take
place without surface energy. An example of them is clouds, forming from atmospheric air that is this type of
substance. These substances are present in cloud chambers, and can be disturbed by the introduction of nucleation
sites, such as by the addition of a “seed crystal”. Name this phenomenon, normally created by heating, in which a
solvent dissolves more of a substance than it can hold in stable solution.
ANSWER: supersaturated solutions [accept supersaturation, etc.]
14. This god borrowed a falcon cloak twice, once involving a male deity wearing Brisingamen, and another when
retrieving golden apples. To make one figure laugh, he tied two ends of a rope to a goat’s beard and his own testicles,
and he once lost an eating contest with Fire. According to one tale, he causes earthquakes by shaking when poison
touches his forehead and his wife Sigyn is not there to catch it. He distracted Svaldifari (SVAL-dee-fahr-ee) and
mated with it, producing an eight-legged horse as a result, and another of his offspring had Tyr’s (TEERZ) hand for a
snack while being bound with Gleipnir (GLIP-neer). The father of Hel and Jormungandr (YOR-moon-gahn-dur),
identify this Norse trickster god.
ANSWER: Loki
15. These entities can undergo gas accretion caused by Roche lobe overflow; in 2004, it was discovered that these led
to the 1572 supernova studied by Tycho Brahe. Pinwheel nebulae can form around these objects, and the discovery of
one of these systems, consisting of pulsars, won the 1993 Nobel in Physics for Hulse and Taylor. Studying the
Doppler shift of spectral lines can allow discovery of spectroscopic types of these, while other types include
astrometric and eclipsing. Name this type of celestial system, the most famous example of which consists of Sirius A
and Sirius B rotating around the pair’s center of mass.
ANSWER: binary star [or binary system, etc.; prompt on answers like star system]
16. A disturbed messenger in this play asks another character “Do you enjoy it? Not afraid of such things?”. The
protagonist engages in a famous dialogue with the chorus about the plight of women, and, like a Sophist, argues with
her weak husband about each of their duties to one another, particularly concerning Pelias’s death. After begging
Creon to stay for one more day, the protagonist is banished from Corinth, but unfortunately for the rest of the
characters is given refuge in Athens by Aegeus. The clever, manipulative, and vengeful protagonist gets her wish when

17. At one point, this figure confronts Peter about his reluctance to eat a meal with Gentiles. This man was also
notable for preaching openly for Barnabus, and for making five separate trips to Jerusalem. In one of his writings, he
noted the importance of “faith, hope, and love”, but that “the greatest of these is love”, and he had earlier had a
conversion experience while on the road to Damascus. Name this former tax collector, a figure of the New Testament
who wrote several of its books in epistle form, including Titus, Ephesians, and First and Second Corinthians.
ANSWER: St. Paul of Tarsus [or Saul of Tarsus]
18. This effect is present in animal bones, possibly to regulate growth. It is analogous to the cause of hum in
transformers, magnetostriction, while in medical imaging, the most common material used for this effect is lead
zirconate titanate. Carbon nanotubes also respond to this effect, for which an especially high quality factor is
possessed by quartz. This phenomenon’s converse consists of an applied field causing a crystal’s dimensions to change.
Discovered by the Curie brothers, identify this effect wherein stress applied to a crystal creates an electric potential
difference.
ANSWER: piezoelectric (pee-AY-zoh-“electric”) effect [or piezoelectricity]
19. One character in this work is renowned for his battles in Flanders, and has an ancestor who “ran his sword
through the heart of Wat Tyler”, while another is a cooper who is his roommate. In this work, a marriage proposal on

character, a narrative poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
ANSWER: “The Courtship of Miles Standish”
20. This man’s ship may have been named after his wife Mattea, or it may have been named the Matthew, and his son
worked with Thomas Pert. Though it’s possible he only made it to Cape Breton Island or Cape Bonavista, this
explorer may have become the first European since the Vikings to step foot on North America. He sailed from Bristol

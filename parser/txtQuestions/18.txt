19. The genes coding for it are extremely polymorphic, and in humans it is alternatively known as the
human leukocyte antigen and is encoded by 6 different loci. For 10 points each:
[10] Identify this extremely variable glycoprotein that is responsible for identifying cells as self and
non-self. All cells express the class I variety, while class II is used to present foreign antigens.
ANSWER: major histocompatibility complex [or MHC]
[10] These surgical procedures require matching of MHC between donors and acceptors. MHC mismatch
in this procedure causes acute rejection, and chronic rejection is staved off using immunosuppressants.
ANSWER: organ transplants [or more specific answers, e.g. kidney transplant]
[10] One commmon immunosuppressant is methotrexate, which stops the reduction of this vitamin from its
di-hydro form to its tetra-hydro form. This vitamin is taken by pregnant women to prevent spina bifida.

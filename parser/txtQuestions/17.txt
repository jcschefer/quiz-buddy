Tossups
1. An article by Henry Labouchere in Truth accused the instigator of this event of using it to increase
stock value. After this event, John Hammond and other members of the Reform Committee were
hanged. It was triggered by an attempt to stop the under-utilization of a railway by blocking wagon
routes in the Drifts Crisis. Joseph Chamberlain implored Hercules Robinson to stop it. The
participants in this event gathered at Pitsani, but later surrendered to (*) Piet Cronje at Doornkop.
After it was put down, Kaiser Wilhem II sent a congratulatory telegram to Paul Kruger. It was partly

2. For a saturated liquid, this value is approximated using the Rackett equation. Powers of the
reciprocal of this quantity are the terms of the virial equation of state. At a constant value of this
quantity, the heat capacity of a monatomic ideal gas is equal to n times the ideal gas constant times
three-halves. The change in this value in response to a mean stress is given by the compressibility
factor. Internal energy plus (*) pressure times this quantity is equal to enthalpy, and isochoric processes
keep it constant. This value is inversely proportional to pressure and directly proportional to temperature
according to the combined gas law. For 10 points, identify this quantity, the amount of space that an object
takes up.
ANSWER: volume [or V]
<Mukherjee>

3. In Baroque music, this key was known as the "trumpet key," since most Baroque trumpet
concertos were written for it. Handel used this key to compose his coronation anthem Zadok the

Communion, but the Council of Trent declared that Jesus's instruction to (*) "Receive ye the Holy

by Francis I after the 1515 battle of Marignano, came from a family that included (*) Ludovico and

12. These entities can change due to rules applied in counter-bleeding, bleeding, or feeding order.
They are composed of subunits marked with plus or minus signs within square brackets, known as

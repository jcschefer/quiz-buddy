QUIZ BOWL BEYOND IDGH SCHOOL
by Regina Allen

Many students participate in scholar bowl on the high school level but what happens after
graduation? Is that it? Far from it! Scholar bowl is alive and well at the college and
university level
My :first experience with scholar bowl coacbing was on the jUDior college level Many of
my students were old pros at this "sport of the mind" from high. school programs.
At the university level, College Bowl is the name of the game. The game format is
standard nationwide. The high school formats CUIreIltly vary from state to state.
College Bowl has a standard procedure for selecting a team. and has established regional
and national championships. Scholar bowl on the university level has been going on for
decades. It is played with a time limit and deductions are taken for wrong answers on
early buzz-ins. The game is played with tossups followed by bonus questions ranging in
value from 20 to 30 points.
The format for the junior college bowl teams may vary a bit. U nIike the universities, most
junior (or community) colleges cannot select a team as instructed by the College Bowl
organization. Participating universities form teams from the student body and have a
playoff. The winning team then represents the university at the College Bowl
competitions.
In my junior college experience, I found I had to recruit students much like a. high school
team. I would inquire with the instructors of the various academic disciplines to find the·
"shining stars." Sometimes interested students would look me up!

The dynamics of my teams were very different from the typical high school team. The
majority of the team usually consisted of former high school stars. The exciting element
was always the returning students who added depth and experience. My younger
members soon became very aware of the great amount of knowledge the older students
brought to the squad.

QlTIZ BOWL BEYOND mGH SCHOOL
continued

During my yearly league play, one of the teams that caused us to compete at our highest
level of efficiency consisted of traditionally more mature students. A team consisting of
such narrow age ranges presented its own unique set of problems. The younger members
were usually quick enough on the buzzer but lacked the depth for the harder bonus
questions. .This meant they had to. work harder as a team and defer the bonus questions
to their more knowledgeable counterparts. The more mature adult team members were
sometimes more reluctant to buzz in and would not usually give information with
confidence. It usually only took one competition for the younger team. members to start
relying more on their knowledge and experience.
College Bowl or scholar bowl, the game essentially stays the same. It pits mind ~oainst
mind and intellect against intellect.
For your high school students loo.lcing to continue their scholar bowl career at the
university or college level, have them inquire about pOSSIble scholarship opportunities
early_
Scholar bowl does not have to end at high school graduationl

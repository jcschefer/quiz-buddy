STARTING A QUIZ BOWL TEAM
by Regina and Riel.: AIlen

September is traditionally the time a quiz bowl coach's fancy turns to starting a successful team.Â· Many
new coaches inherit the job from someone else who either retired or retired from the field of academic
competition. The task can seem a bit overwhelming at first, but it does not have to be. Here are a few tips
to help the new coach get off to a successful stan.
1) First of all, you must realize (though you may be among the few who do) that academic competition is

just as important and deserving of your school's resources as any other activity including athletic
activities. While few athletes go on to use their athletic abilities in professional careers, it is safe to
say that all of the students participating in academic competition will use their academic abilities in
their professional careers.
Do NOT be discouraged by the amount of resources available to you. The greatest coaches are
usually the ones who have had to get by on their own. Big budgets are practically unheard of for
academic teams. Sure, you can try, but do not expect miracles overnight. You've no doubt heard
the old saying "Where there's a will, there's a way!" It will apply to you. Go ahead, reCruit a team,
start practicing, enter some competitions, and interest will start to be created. Administrators will
begin to pay attention. Some parents are always interested in what their children are doing. This
will be a novel and unique activity - at least, the kids won't come home sweaty and dirty (welL not
usually!)
2) Unless your school has had a successful quiz bowl team in the past, you will have to recruit a team.
This may be difficult as quiz bowl activities often compete for the attention of students with football,
basketball, cheerleading, Spanish Club, music, and other extra-curricular activities. One way to
recruit is to approach teachers of various subjects in your school - ask for their opinions. Another
teacher may have developed a rapport with particular students that you have not - take advantage of
this. Speak to other clubs about quiz bowl activities - talk about tournaments and the excitement of
competition.
3) You will probably want to have tryouts for the team. How does a coach select a successful team?
One of the keys here is variety. Most states have 4 or 5 members on a team, though you will want to
recruit at least twice this number. You will need to have a team composed of students with various
strengths. No student is going to be an "expert" on all subjects. You will need students with
strengths in science, mathematics, social sciences, language, literature, as well general knowledge.
Sometimes the best quiz bowl players are not the ones with the best GPA. Instead the best players are
often above average students with varied interests (not necessarily your "straight A students). An
example of this might be a good chemistry student who enjoys reading about the Renaissance period.
When you have tryouts for your team, use an electronic lockout system. This will demonstrate how
the student will perform in actual competition. Written tests are good at measuring knowledge, but
unless competition in your area consists of written tests, this will not be a good measurement.
Triple Q Questions has developed a software package, Quiz Doctor, to help in diagnOSing
team strengths and weaknesses. This is an excellent tool to use for selection of a team because
it simulates actual quiz bowl competition and provides graphic results for you of each student's
results.

STARTING A QUIZ BOWL TEAM
(continued)

4) Schedule your first practice session no later than early September, jfpossible. After-school
is an excellent time to practice. Let the kids have fun! Practice one group of students against
another. This will fu.rther help you to determine strengths and weaknesses. It is helpful jf
a third party can keep an individual tally of statistics by student. Not only watch for correctness
of answers, but also pay attention to questions in which the student rang in with an incorrect answer.
Quickness on the "buzzer" can be a virtue, but jf done improperly, it can he fatal. Some Students
who are not quick on the buzzer may be lifesavers when it comes to bonus questions.
5) It will take some money to operate a team. Talk, to your administration - they may be more receptive
than you might think to increasing the team's budget. Talk up the opportunities with every member
of the community you come in contact with. Many school teams are supported by academic booster
clubs. Fund-raising is also an option for monetary support.
6)

Obtain practice questions. Thousands of questions can be obtained from a quiz bowl supplier
for a reasonable price. Most questions are timeless and can be used year after year with different
teams.
Obviously, your team will need an electronic lockout system. Do not be discouraged by high prices.
An efficient system can be obtained for under $300. There are many different kinds oflockout

systems on the market with many different features, however, many of the "bells and whistles" are
not required.
7)

Sign up for competitions with other schools early in the year. It is important to get a new team
competing to encourage interest among your team's members. Waiting until the team gets pexfect
may cause members to lose interest. There is probably a league of schools in your geographic area
who compete on a regular basis. Inquire about membership in their league and participation in
their competitions.

8)

Encourage parent and community involvement in unique and novel ways. One idea that has worked
successfully is to have a competition during half-time at a basketball game. Another is to have the
students compete against the teachers andlor parents. Make quiz bowl fun for students and everyone
else involved.

9)

Consult other coaches. Most professionals are willing to share their ideas and provide tips to new
coaches. The most successful teams are often the ones in which the coach was willing to listen to
some sound advice from a friend.

10) Most importantly, never give up! Quiz bowl is a valuable and worthwhile activity for today's
students. Besides providing them \\'ith a sense of achievement, it is preparing them for the tough
reality we call life.

ROUNDING UP ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE:
THE EAST TEXAS STATE FAm ACADEMIC RODEO
contributed by Betty S. Mallory
During its 81 year history, the East Texas State Fair Association has recognized the talents
of their youth through the Future Fanner's Association and the 4-H Clubs. Recognizing
that we are no longer a predominately agrarian society, Fair officials began to look for
ways to reach into other areas of interest for their youth. In 1991 the Fair came up with
the idea of working with the school systems to promote excellence in education and
showcase the talents of their youth in all areas. School officials responded enthusiastically
to this idea.
The Tyler Independent School District was the participating school district for the first
two years of the Academic Rodeo, participating in four events: a Writing Contest, an Art
Contest, Band and Choral Concerts, and Theater. In the ensuing years, participation has
expanded to 12 Independent School Districts (3 7 campuses), 3 parochial schools, 1 group
of Home Educators and 1 Children's School of Performing Arts.
-Each year, at least one event has been added. Events for the 1996 Academic Rodeo are:
Academic Challenge Quiz, Science Fair, Spelling Bee for 2nd and 3ed grades, Band and
Choral Concerts, Art Coniest, 4-H Style Show, Writing Contest, Theater Groups, and a
General Agriculture Identification Contest. The schools are also given the opportunity to
display any other programs that might be unique to their campus such as Head Start,
Career and Applied Technology, Gifted and Talented Programs or any other programs
each sc~ool might have.
The Academic Challenge Quiz is an exciting, fast-paced contest, highlighting the
knowledge and quick thinking skills of the brightest junior high or middle school students.
Teams offour students and two alternates from each school participate in the event. The
American Association of Business Women (AAUW) - Tyler Branch co-sponsors and
facilitates the event with the advice and consent of the Academic Rodeo Committee of the
East Texas State Fair Association. Some questions and all equipment for this event are
secured through Triple Q Questions. The school ofthe winning team receives a roving
team trophy with each member of the winning team receiving a $100.00 EE U.S. Savings
Bond and each alternate receiving a $50.00 EE U.S. Savings Bond.
A packet containing a description, rules, and regulations on all events is sent to all schools
and educational groups in a 50 mile radius of the facility. To secure a copy ofthis.packet,
contact the East Texas State Fair, 2112 W. Front Street, Tyler, TX 75701 or phone
(903)597-2501 or FAX (903)592-0692.
NOTE: This idea is spreading to the West. Ventura County, California is sponsoring an
academic rodeo beginning in 1996.

A LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE
FOUNDING OF TRIPLE QQUESTIONS

Triple Q Questions was founded in 1990 by Rick and Regina Allen, a husband and wife team. For several
years, Regina was the scholar bowl coach at Southeastern Illinois Community College in Harrisburg,
Illinois. She led the team to many state and regional titles during her tenure there. When the company
was founded in 1990,:Reginaleft the active world of quiz bowl coaching, but took on a much more active
role in the quiz bowl world.. Triple Q Questions began quite small, but the question writing was fast and
furious. Over the years the product line has grown from packers of practice and competition questions to
include practice books of questions, diagnostic software, an electronic lockout system, and now the
Triple Q Questions Academic Gazette. Customized work has also brought new opportunities and
challenges. Over the years, our questions have been used in several state, regional, and national
tournaments, by television stations, and even in some prisons. While the business was once operated
with a huge copier in the kitchen (we are not kidding!), it now occupies its own office connected to our
home.

The Triple Q family has grown also. We currently have two employees - Mary and Carol. (You may
speak to one of them when you call). We also like to include Joanna, age 5, andJulianna, age 7 months.
They contribute a lot to.the business as well (even if it is just staying out of the way!)
What else do we do? NOT MUCH, who has time? Seriously, Regina teaches Economics part-time for a
local college, is on the local school board, and takes care of the kids. Her hobbies include gardening and
being outside. Rick's college background was in History. He works in the health insurance field and
enjoys genealogy as his main hobby.

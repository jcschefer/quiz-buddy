2. Tetrabenazine was recently approved to treat this disease, functioning by inhibiting VMAT-2. While this disease’s
mechanism is not fully understood, it is known to result in nuclear inclusion bodies, which may explain the toxicity
caused by its characteristic protein misfolding. On a larger scale, it damages the striatum in the brain, likely

namesake protein, identify this neurodegenerative autosomal dominant disease whose onset comes around age 40.

writing a philosophical examination of mathematics entitled The Subjective Synthesis. This man coined a word that
describes one’s unselfish concern for the well-being of others. He speculated that man goes through phases of
animism, polytheism, and monotheism in the larger Theocratic Stage, a part of his Law of the Three Stages. He also

arm is at a ninety degree angle and holds a stick. The artist’s signature is seen in the extreme bottom right corner, just
below a partially concealed red vase, presumably full of water, given the location. The brightness of the central figure’s
multicolored garment contrasts with the darkness of the creature above her which lurks under the moonlight. A
mandolin appears on the desert sand next to the dark-skinned title figure of this painting, which is classified as PostImpressionist and Primitivist. Name this oil painting in which a lion mystically examines a defenseless woman, a work
by Henri Rousseau.

6. The narrator of this work returns home from Trinity Church to find that his key won’t work because the title
character is inside. One of the title character’s coworkers only makes mistakes in the afternoon, and another coworker

general election, and in 1990, she was elected Prime Minister of her country, her party winning 59% of the vote. The
junta, however, threw out the results and instead placed her under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years. The junta
is now headed by Than Shwe. Name this Burmese winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.
ANSWER: Aung San Suu Kyi
8. As developed by the LCAO procedure, this phenomenon arises because the Schrödinger equation is linear, so
linear combinations of solutions to it are also valid solutions. One model predicts that hydrogen sulfide would exhibit
this phenomenon, but it is not observed because the bonds lengths are high, decreasing electron-electron repulsions. It
applies to the central atoms of methane, ammonia, and water, and was proposed by Linus Pauling. Name this
phenomenon from VSEPR (ves-pur) theory in which two atomic orbitals mix to create new ones, such as
the sp orbital.
ANSWER: hybridization [accept word forms; accept hybridized orbitals, etc.]
9. This Christian sect adopted a Book of Common Prayer with revised liturgy so that its clergy would not be guilty of
treason; this was done at its 1789 founding in Philadelphia. Headed today by Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts
Schori, its services always include a prayer for the Archbishop of Canterbury, since it is part of the Anglican
Communion with the Church of England. It uses a symbol of a shield with the Cross of St. George and a smaller
Cross of St. Andrew in its canton, since its succession of bishops can be traced to both England and Scotland. Identify
this American Christian sect.
ANSWER: Episcopalian Church [prompt on Anglican Church or Church of England before “1789”]
10. If not for this property’s introduction, omega-minus baryons would violate the Pauli exclusion principle. This
property actually increases with distance from the particles that possess it. It changes when a quark gives off a gluon,
and combines with its anti- variety to form mesons. Particles with this property cannot be isolated, its namesake
confinement. This quantity can have three values, which can combine neutrally to form a baryon, while particles
without this property are known as leptons and are not subject to the strong nuclear force. Name this property
possessed by gluons and quarks, studied in quantum chromodynamics.
ANSWER: color charge
11. This woman becomes enamored with Brazilian culture, and in one scene, cooks with a “Jets to Brazil” poster in the

By the end of the movie, she kisses Paul, a struggling writer, who like her, provides company to wealthy, older patrons.

one of his plays, the Man and the Card Player are encountered by the Crowd, a group of actors who play a rope game.

equipment, Buying a Fishing Rod for My Grandfather. His most famous work details a man with cancer who travels

ANSWER: Gao Xingjian [or Kao Hsieng-chien]
13. This figure is sometimes referred to as Mekhenty-er-irty, or “he who has no eyes,” while his childish aspect is
called Harpokrates (har-PAWK-ruh-teez). When his vision is impaired, he has been known to decapitate the deities
fighting at his side. His elder form was among the children of Geb and Nut, while in his younger form, he tore off one

ANSWER: Adlai Ewing Stevenson II
15. Devised to test Alexander Oparin’s 1924 hypothesis, experiments similar to this one were performed by Wilde
and MacNevin. A purely aqueous variation used hydrogen cyanide to produce adenine, and was performed by Joan
Oró. A 2008 reanalysis of the solutions in this experiment found that the “volcanic” version of the experiment
produced far more compounds than previously realized—not five, but twenty-two amino acids. Using an electrical
spark to simulate lightning and producing organic compounds from hydrogen, ammonia, water, and methane, name
this 1952 experiment which demonstrated the feasibility of abiogenesis on an early Earth.
ANSWER: Miller-Urey experiment [or Urey-Miller experiment]
16. The name of this country was restored when it won its independence in 1980, and two years later its capital lost
the name Salisbury. Its former leader remained in Parliament until 1987; he had worked out deals with Abel
Muzorewa and the British government to hold national elections. That leader, who signed a Unilateral Declaration of
Independence, was Ian Smith, head of the Rhodesian Front party. One of the leaders in its fight for independence was
Joshua Nkomo, who worked with the man who became its first Prime Minister and still serves as its President,
sharing power with Morgan Tsvangirai. Name this troubled country in southern Africa headed by Robert Mugabe.
ANSWER: Zimbabwe
17. Markov’s inequality can be used with Chebyshev’s inequality to derive one form of this law, a form that also leads
to the asymptotic equipartition property. The other form of this theorem applies if the sum of all variances divided by
the index squared converges; that is known as the Kolmogorov criterion, and applies to the strong version of this
theorem, which adds that the convergence is almost sure. With a name coined by Simeon Poisson, identify this law
that states that as n approaches infinity, the arithmetic mean of n random variables converges to its expected value.
ANSWER: law of large numbers [accept “weak” or “strong” as a modifier; accept Bernoulli’s Theorem]

(1) Donald Knuth showed that a permutation can be sorted with one of these data structures if
and only if it does not contain the pattern “two three one”. In C-based languages, memory
allocation at runtime takes place in the heap and in this data structure, and they are
implemented in reverse Polish notation for calculations. Some variants of this data structure
make use of an operation to “peek” at the top element, although there are only two essential
operations, one which adds an element to the top and the other which removes the top
element; those operations are push and pop. For ten points, name this last-in-first-out data
structure.

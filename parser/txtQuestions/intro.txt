Rules of Play
Abstract
by Samer Ismail
Yale Student Academic Competitions
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Each tossup is worth 10 points, or in specific cases, as explained below, 20 points.
There is NEYERa penalty for a wrong answer.
Acorrect answer ALWAYJearns first chance at a bonus question.
Opponents can ALWAYJsteal on missed bonus opportunities.
CONSULTATION on tossups is not allowed on tossups but is allowed for bonus/team questions.
PART ONE: RELATED TOSSUP/BONUS [300 points total]
Ten tossups will be asked, each worth 10 poi nts.
Correct answers earn first chance at a bonus worth 20 points, related in some manner to the tossup. For
example, a tossup on liThe Old Man and the Sea ll could be followed by a question on other works by
Ernest Hemingway, or by a question on seas, or even Jack lemmon &Walter Mattheau (Grumpy Old
Men).
Bonus questions will consist of multiple parts and/or multiple answers required.
No one-part, one-answer 1120 points all-or-nothingll questions will be used, but there may be 1120 points on
the first clue, 10 on the second (5 on the third?)11 questions.
PART TWO: THE CATEGORY QUIZ [200 points total]
[This is the most unique feature of the tournament.]
Eight tossups will be asked, worth 10 each.
Correct answers earn the right to choose a category for a one-part bonus question worth 15 points.
There are 10 categories (out of 13 standard) in each round (e.g., Mathematics, World History, etc.); some
may be more specific (e.g., Asian History, American Poets). Each category can only be used once, as
there is only one question per category.
PART THREE: THE STRETCH ROUND [500 points total]
Ten IIpower" tossups: tossups are worth 20 points until the moderator completes the phrase IIfor 10 pointsll,
after which it is worth 10. Thus, at all times, everyone knows the tossup1s value.
Acorrect answer earns a chance at a 30-point bonus question, which is not related to the tossup. The bonus
questions require multiple answers and/or multiple parts, as in the Opening Round.

For this section, there will be 13 different categories corresponding to areas in which most academic teams
should be fairly knowledgable. None of these categories will change during the course of the entire
tournament.
S tandard Ca.tegory Q uiz ca.tegories

American literature
Fine Arts
Physical Sciences
Sports and Entertainment
World literature

American History
General Knowledge and Trivia
Religion, Mythology, and
Philosophy
World Geography

Biological Sciences
Mathematics
Social Sciences
World History

10 of the 13 categories will be available in anyone game. Each category contains only one question. Before
the Category Quiz begins, each team will be notified which the ten categories are in play during this part of
the match. Subcategories may also be listed to further describe the topics involved with a category quiz
team question, e.g., World History (Asia) or American literature (Poets).
Eight more tossups will be read, each worth 10 points. If a team gets a tossup right, the team can decide a
bonus question to be picked from the available Categories. Each Category Bonus question is worth 15 points,
and usually will involve one answer. There is only one question available per category, so once a category
has been selected, no one can pick that category again. However, if the quiz question is answered
incorrectly, the opposing team can steal the points if they can answer that question correctly.
Adetailed breakdown of the curriculum into these categories may be found on the CWRU Trivia Club web
page at http://www.cwru.edu/orgs/trivialglrac/ .

The Real [rey-ahl] Situado was paid using profits from this resource, and the Athenians mined
this resource at Laurium. The lead ore galena is an important source for this material, while Romans
extracted it with gold from electrum. The discovery of ​
(*) South American tracts for this resource
eventually spurred the opening of the Potosi Mines, and it was later found at the Comstock Lode in
Nevada. Supporters of this substance often referred to the “Crime of ’73” and used the slogan “16 to 1”.
For 10 points, name this rare metal that no longer backs US currency and which is used today to make
second-place medals.
ANSWER: ​
silver
20. This process changes time signals into frequency domains. For 10 points,
[10] Name this process which is used to decompose periodic functions. Its namesake analysis is related to
the theory of using this transformation to represent any wave as a sum of various sine waves.
ANSWER: ​
Fourier Transform
[10] The Fourier transform of a particle’s position is taken to be this value, which, in classical mechanics,
equals an object’s mass times its velocity and is symbolized p.
ANSWER: linear ​
momentum
[10] Fourier analysis can be used to prove this statement, which asserts that the position and the
momentum of a particle cannot both be known simultaneously.
ANSWER: Heisenberg ​
Uncertainty principle​

Strain gauges measure strain by detecting changes in this quantity, which relies on electrons
being raised beyond the “band gap”. A Wheatstone bridge can be used to find an unknown fourth
value of this quantity, and the quantum Hall effect was used to standardize the representation of this
value’s units in multiples of the ​
(*) von Klitzing constant. This quantity’s inverse AC counterpart is
admittance, the reciprocal of which is composed of this and reactance. This quantity is proportional to
length over cross-sectional area. FTP, name this electrical quantity defined as voltage over current and
measured in Ohms.
ANSWER: electrical ​
resistance​
[accept conductance until “units”]

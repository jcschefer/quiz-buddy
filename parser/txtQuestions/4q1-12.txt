Round 12
Tiebreaker Questions
1. Nomenclature for oxygen-containing examples of these entities dictates that the most prevalent species
receives the suffix -ate, and the species with one fewer oxygen than that receives the suffix -ite. Oxygen-free
examples of them include ferricyanide. Monatomic ones are typically referred to by the name of the atom
and the suffix -ide, as in sulfide and fluoride. These chemical species carry an extra electron, resulting in a
negative charge. For 10 points, identify these chemical species, which form ionic bonds with cations.
ANSWER: anions [accept polyatomic anions before "monatomic" is read; prompt on ions before "electron"
is read]

reproduces by using the lytic cycle, and can be called temperate if they use the lysogenic cycle. Ones with an
RNA genome are known as "retro" ones. These entities consist of genetic material encased by a capsid coat.
The tobacco mosaic one was the first isolated. Ones that infect bacteria are known as phages. For 10 points,

3. The system for using these in Finnish is so complicated that a list of place names is published that advises
whether to use the inessive, the elative, or other examples of them. Japanese and English have almost none
of these. Russian has “prepositional” and “instrumental” ones. Written Latin rarely makes use of the
locative or vocative ones. Latin more frequently displays the ablative, dative, or accusative version of, for 10
points, what grammatical state, which often uses a word ending to indicate a noun’s function in a sentence?
ANSWER: noun cases [or noun inflections]

10. Hippolyte Fizeau discovered this effect independently from its namesake in 1848. In spectral lines, this
effect causes a namesake "broadening." In astronomy, it can be used to calculate radial velocities of
neighboring galaxies. When two astronomical objects are moving away from each other, this effect produces
red shift. Its applications include sonar and radar. For 10 points, name this effect in which the apparent
frequency of a wave changes with the relative velocity of the observer to the source.

3. The larvae of some organisms of this phylum are called veligers. Organisms in this phylum feed through
ribbons of tiny teeth called radula. Many organisms of this phylum can secrete calcium carbonate through
their mantle to create a dorsal covering. Other members of this phylum can create spiral shells or produce
pearls. Classes in this phylum include Cephalopoda and Gastropoda. For 10 points, name this phylum that
includes organisms like snails, squid, and clams.

1. This unit is multiplied by meters per kilogram squared in the universal gravitational constant, and
by meters per Coulomb squared in the Coulomb constant. Electric field strength is measured in this

meter. This unit can be expressed as a product of mass and acceleration, making it equivalent to one
kilogram times one meter per second squared. For 10 points, name this unit used to measure force.

multiplies the value for (*) enthalpy by this number. e to the power of i pi gives this number, whose
square root is taken for the definition of the imaginary unit. It is the exponent of x for one over x. For 10
points, identify this integer that changes the sign of a number multiplied by it.

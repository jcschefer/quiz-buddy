CATEGORY ROUND
American Literature: Families in Literature
Team A: Name the American playwright who wrote about a bickering husband and wife in the play Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?.
ANSWER: Edward Franklin Albee III
Team B: Albee wrote a stage version of Breakfast at Tiffany's, based on the novella by what other author,
who himself wrote about the murder of a family in the book In Cold Blood?
ANSWER: Truman Capote [or Truman Struckfus Persons]
Tossup: Throughout this play, the noise of a foghorn is heard, which is judged to be “like a banshee.” Its
characters include Eugene, who died of measles years earlier after being infected by his brother. The only
secondary character to appear on stage in this play is the Irish summer maid, Cathleen. Another character
refuses to believe her son Edmund has contracted tuberculosis. Heavily autobiographical, this play features
the drunken actor James and his morphine-addicted wife Mary. Name this play chronicling a day in the life
of the Tyrone family, a work of Eugene O’Neill.
ANSWER: Long Day’s Journey into Night
Mathematics: Algebra (All questions in this round are 30 seconds)
Team B: Consider the curve described in parametric coordinates by the two equations x = t over 2 and y
equals t squared minus 4 t minus 5. Find the equation relating y to x.
ANSWER: y equals 4 x squared minus 8 x minus 5 [or y = 4x2-8x-5]
Team A: Find the sum of the squares of the roots of the quadratic x squared minus 3 x minus 10.
ANSWER: 29
Tossup: These types of equations are constraints for functions whose maximums are found through the
simplex method. The ordinary least squares method finds this type of equation that minimizes the distance
between its y-values and those of a sample. If a set of them is expressed in matrix form, their solutions can
be found by putting the matrix into reduced row echelon form. Cramer's rule is another method to solve for
a system of equations of this type. They can be written in the point-slope form, or the slope-intercept form.
Name these polynomials of degree one.
ANSWER: linear equation

ANSWER: lepton
Tossup: Whether photons have this quantity was the subject of the Abraham-Minkowski controversy. The
change in this quantity is equal to the impulse. It's not velocity, but this property and position cannot be
known with perfect precision by Heisenberg's principle. Newton's second law says the time derivative of it
is equal to force. Newton's laws of motion also imply its conservation in a closed system. Name this
quantity equal to the product of velocity and mass.
ANSWER: linear momentum

the brainchild of DeWitt Clinton, and another was returned to its home country by Jimmy Carter. Name
these structures, including the Erie and Panama, that link two waterways.

FINAL ROUND
1. One type of these compounds can be used to bring ionic salts into an organic phase and are called the
"phase transfer" type of them. One mole per second is the namesake SI unit describing the function of these

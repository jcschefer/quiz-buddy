Otohime, the daughter of its ruler Watatsumi. After traversing this location, the Hare of Inaba is skinned
by angry wanizame. A god of this place puts his son-in-law Okuninushi through a series of tests, and
earlier transforms a young girl into a comb in order to slay the eight- (*) headed serpent Yamato-no-Orochi.
That god of this place tosses a flayed horse at his sister, who flees into a cave. The nose of Izanagi produces a god
of storms and this realm who is the brother of Tsukiyomi and Amaterasu. For 10 points, identify this domain ruled

2. The expression of an enzyme produced by this system is visually confirmed in a blue-white screen. A
scientist who studied this system theorized that it is characterized by the "diauxic growth" model. IPTG
is an analog of a compound that induces this system. EIIA shuts down a permease enzyme and the
catabolite activator protein, or CAP, inactivates this set of genes during unfavorable (*) environmental
conditions. However, when conditions are right, cAMP binds to CAP, promoting this set of genes. Jacob and
Monod won the Nobel for discovering this set of genes, which produces beta-galactosidase and is turned off when
glucose is available. For 10 points, name this operon in E. coli which controls the metabolism of a sugar found in
milk.
ANSWER: lac operon [or lactose operon; prompt on operon until mentioned] <Gupta>

Kevin Rudd, and Tony Abbott.
ANSWER: Prime Minister of Australia <Bentley>
4. This process "activates" cell sorting in the most common method of flow cytometry. This process
corresponds to the decay from S1 to S0 without internal conversion on a Jablonski diagram. This
phenomenon is "recovered" after photobleaching in a technique used to study the cell membrane. The
Stern-Volmer equation gives the decrease in quantum yield of this process in the presence of (*) quenchers.
A common reporter protein which undergoes this process has a serine-tyrosine-glycine motif in a beta barrel. An
arrow drawn from the excited to ground state represents this phenomenon, in which electrons absorb energy, and
then emit at a lower wavelength, generating light. For 10 points, name this type of luminescence shown by GFP.

about his brother's death in Auschwitz to explain why he raises his son in silence. After a character in this

horizontal force. For 10 points each:
[10] The horizontal force you apply on the book is exactly equal in magnitude to this force, which is proportional to
the frictional force, and is perpendicular to the surface of contact.
ANSWER: normal force [or N]
[10] If the book does not move, then this quantity equals the weight of the book divided by your applied force. For

(4) Based on factors such as ring strain, Bredt’s rule governs the formation of the bridgehead
types of these compounds.
These compounds are produced by the reaction of a
carbonyl-containing compound with an ylide in the Wittig reaction. Another way to
produce these compounds is through elimination reactions, examples of which include the
dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides. Zaitsev’s rule predicts the products of reactions that
produce these to give the more highly substituted ones of these. In the presence of a lindlar
catalyst, they can be produced from alkynes by addition of hydrogen. For ten points, name

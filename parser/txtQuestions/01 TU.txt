1. This man’s namesake orchard consists of one-dimensional trees planted at lattice points in the plane. His namesake
metric is the L-P metric with p equaling two, which is also the “usual” metric. His namesake algorithm subtracts
integer multiples of one given number from another to compute the two numbers’ greatest common factor. He also
names geometries that assume that given a line and a point not on it, there is exactly one line that does not intersect
the given line. His most famous work started from five axioms and five postulates. Name this mathematician who
created the parallel postulate in his treatise on geometry, The Elements—an ancient Greek.
ANSWER: Euclid of Alexandria [or Eukleídēs]
2. This man announced that he was taking over his country during a newscast, and his government lasted five days
before being handed to Josef Terboven. He was Minister of Defense before that but left the government to form the

3. The last line of the seventy-seventh section of this work is now translated as saying, “To die but not be forgotten is
longevity” since the 1973 discovery of two copies of this text in a tomb. Fourteen new sections were discovered in a
tomb in 1993, and the ordering of the previously known 81 sections is now in doubt. This book was supposedly
written in the sixth century BCE by a record-keeper at the Zhou court. The religion that holds this piece holy is very
popular in China and Southeast Asia, and holds the Yin Yang in high esteem. Name this holy text written by Lao Tzu
that preaches serenity, virtue, and following of The Way.
ANSWER: Tao Te Ching [or Dao De Ching]
4. In combination with the London equation, this law can be used to find the penetration depth in the Meissner effect.
Its original form implied that the magnetic field was solenoidal. It can also be expressed as “the curl of the H-field
equals the conduction current”, and for static fields, this law is equivalent to the Biot-Savart law. Its original form was
incompatible with capacitors, so Maxwell added a term of the time-derivative of the E-field, the displacement current,
to this equation. This law states that the free current is proportional to the path integral of magnetic field with respect
to displacement. Used to find the magnetic field produced by a wire, name this one of Maxwell’s equations, named for
a French physicist.
ANSWER: Ampère’s Circuit Law [or the Ampère-Maxwell Law]
5. Sports Illustrated writer Rick Reilly labeled this golfer’s failure at the 1996 Masters the “worst collapse in major

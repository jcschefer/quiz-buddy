1. Types of this phenomenon include skeletal and positional. For 10 points each:
[10] Name this phenomenon in which molecules have the same molecular formula but different atomic arrangements.
Pentane and 2-methylbutane are examples, as are 2-hexanol and 3-hexanol.
ANSWER: structural isomerism [or constitutional isomerism; prompt on isomerism]
[10] Dimethyl ether and ethanol are examples of this special type of structural isomerism, where the atoms are
arranged so as to create entirely different component groups. It is exemplified by cyclohexane and any form of hexene.
ANSWER: functional group isomerism

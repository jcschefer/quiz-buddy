1. This quantity can be measured with a Fabry-Pérot pendulum, while its Gaussian version is the square root of the
quantity typically referred to by this name. A better-known experiment for determining this value was originally
conceived to measure the density of the earth; it used two large lead balls connected to a torsion balance, and was
conducted by Henry Cavendish. It also appears as the constant of proportionality in an inverse-square law named for
Newton. Name this constant that, in units of kilogram meters squared per second squared, is approximately equal to
6.67 times ten to the negative eleven.
ANSWER: universal gravitational constant [accept big G; prompt on G; accept Newton’s constant before
“Newton”]

defending commander. Eudo, the earlier victor at the Battle of Toulouse who was also known as Odo the Great,
submitted to another leader after losing at the River Garonne. Though this battle actually took place at Moussais-labataille, it is commonly referred to by the location of the wealthy abbey the invaders wished to loot. A Frankish square

defeated by Charles Martel to halt Arab expansion into Europe in 732 CE.

insistence of Loki. Name this Norse god of beauty and light.
ANSWER: Baldr
7. Many textbooks give this group’s elements’ electron affinities as extremely endothermic, but recent research
revealed that their ions are stable and that the correct electron affinities for this group are quite low. These elements
are soluble in ammonia, and act as reducing agents. Their affinity for water is so strong that many of their salts
crystallize into hydrates, such as Epsom salt and gypsum, their sulfates. Because of their high electropositivity, ths
group’s elements generally form plus-two ions. Name this group of silvery, soft metals that includes radium,
strontium, barium, calcium, magnesium, and beryllium; group IIa on the periodic table.

suggested that the nominal interest rate be set to zero in his namesake rule and said that banks should increase the
money supply every year in his k-percent rule. He argued that Keynesian economics result in stagflation on his
program Free to Choose, and he wrote that inflexible monetary policy during the 1920s caused the market crash in a

poetry was addressed to his special lady asking to “Let us live” and “Let us love”, in addition to requesting exactly 3,300
kisses, then requesting that they all be mixed up so no one will be jealous of “how many kisses [they] have shared”.
Penning the famous words “Odi et amo”, identify this Golden Age Roman poet who wrote of his love for Lesbia.
ANSWER: Gaius Valerius Catullus
10. The synthesis of this molecule is described by the Boyer model, and takes place by beta units switching between
“tight” and “loose” configurations in its namesake enzyme, which consists of a knob, rod, and rotor. It is produced
especially quickly in cells with myoglobin. Its most important function can be catalyzed by polynucleotide kinase, and
involves the breaking of one phosphate bond to release energy. Name this molecule produced in the Krebs cycle, the
“energy currency” of cells.
ANSWER: ATP [or adenosine 5′ triphosphate]
11. This man’s supporters included August Scheurer-Kestner and Georges Picquart. Bernard Lazare supported him
by putting his handwritten notes on posters. An open letter supporting this man was later published on the front page
of The Aurora, selling over two hundred thousand copies and swaying public opinion. This man served a ten-year

12. In one of this man’s works, a civil servant believes himself to have intercepted love letters between two dogs that
are having an affair. That same titular character also took part in an imaginary coronation ceremony when he thought
himself heir to the throne of Spain. Another of this author’s works sees the a corrupt Mayor bamboozled by a man

comes off his face and runs away. Identify this author and playwright behind Diary of a Madman, The Inspector
General, Dead Souls, The Overcoat, and The Nose.
ANSWER: Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol
13. This set, a commutative monoid, is the domain of Landau’s function as well as of the totient (TOH-shent)
function, and numbers of this type can be written as the sum of other numbers of this type via a partition. According
to the well-ordering principle, any subset of this set contains a least element. Multiplication and addition on this set
are recursively defined along with a successor function by the Peano axioms. According to the Archimedean property,
there exists one of these numbers larger than any given real number; and all inductive sets contain these numbers as a
subset. Contained in both the rationals and the integers, name this set of the positive integers, denoted N.
ANSWER: natural numbers [or naturals; accept N before the end; prompt on integers; accept positive integers
or nonnegative integers before “positive integers”; accept whole numbers before the end]
14. The last recorded philosopher who adopted views associated with this school was Sallustius of Emesa. Hipparchia
was a notable female member of this school of philosophy, and she married Crates of Thebes, a better-known
advocate. Autarkia and Askesis are two concepts associated with this school, in addition to Shamelessness. Socrates’
pupil Antisthenes was probably the first to outline the views associated with this school, although a man who lived in
a barrel and held a lamp up in search of an honest man is more famous. Name this Greek school of philosophy which
holds that one should attain Virtue by living a life free from possessions and in harmony with Nature, associated with
Diogenes of Sinope (SI-nohp).
ANSWER: Cynicism
15. Like sulfuric acid, this substance is used as a catalyst in the alkylation of isobutane. When used with antimony
trifluoride to treat chloroform, Teflon is created. This chemical is prepared by reacting its anion’s namesake mineral
with sulfuric acid, or as a byproduct in the creation of phosphoric acid. It does not completely dissociate in water, so it
penetrates skin very easily, reacting with calcium to dissolve bone. Because of the very low entropy of hydration for its
anion, despite being incredibly corrosive, it is a weak acid; that high strength comes from the strongest-known bond
with hydrogen. Stored in Teflon containers, name this haloacid used to etch glass, with formula HF.
ANSWER: hydrofluoric acid [accept HF before the end; accept aqueous hydrogen fluoride]
16. This composer’s opera Agrippo was re-discovered in 2006, and he composed three concertos for sopranino
recorder that are often played on the piccolo today. This early proponent of the clarinet composed a three-act opera
adaptation of the Ludovico Ariosto epic Orlando Furioso, but he is more famous for more than 300 concertos,
including a set from The Contest Between Harmony and Invention that opens with the composer’s own poetry and
includes La Primavera. Identify this prominent Venetian baroque red-headed orphanage teacher, the composer of The
Four Seasons.
ANSWER: Antonio Lucio Vivaldi

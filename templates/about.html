                     Quizbowl, like any other activity, requires practice for improvement. However, one of two problems always arise. If you're alone, the problem is that reading a question doesn't provide the same experience as listening to a reader. If you're in a group, the problem is that someone always has to sit out in order to read questions.

                     This website was designed to provide both a way for individuals to practice on their own and a way for groups to practice together without anyone sitting out.
